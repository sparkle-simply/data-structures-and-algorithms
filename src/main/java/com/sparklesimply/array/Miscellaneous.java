     * i + j < n
     * Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1]. The test cases are generated such that you can reach nums[n - 1].

     * Use a greedy approach where we expand range from l to r, and at each point, calculate the farthest position reachable
     * Time complexity: O(n) as every index is visited atmost once with r getting updated to farthest index

     * Problem Statement: There are n friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. More formally, moving clockwise from the ith friend brings you to the (i+1)th friend for 1 <= i < n, and moving clockwise from the nth friend brings you to the 1st friend.
     * The rules of the game are as follows:
     * Start at the 1st friend.
     * Count the next k friends in the clockwise direction including the friend you started at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once.
     * The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.
     * If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step 2 starting from the friend immediately clockwise of the friend who just lost and repeat.
     * Else, the last friend in the circle wins the game.
     * Given the number of friends, n, and an integer k, return the winner of the game.
     * Approach: simulating elimination process mathematically, instead of removing people from an actual list, we just keep track of the winner's position using simple arithmetic
